Hello there!

I'm Rain. A self taught Godot game developer. I'm a junior level programmer and I have learned Python, C#, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
I'm interested in exploring more about being a game developer and create my own stuffs. I hope I can learn more from small projects
and improve my skills overtime. 

See you later in my future projects!! ðŸŒ±ðŸŒ±ðŸŒ±
